                I'm a third-year at the University of Chicago with a major in Economics and a minor in Computer Science. I'm curious about virtually everything, with particular interests in the societal implications of emerging technologies like AI, US-China competition, and economic development.

                In the past few years, I've been lucky to work at a diverse range of places that I feel have given me a unique blend of deep technical experience and real-world policy impact. Outside of work, I love to travel, write, and go for long bike rides (especially along Lake Michigan!).
