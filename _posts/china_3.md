title: "A quarter in China: notes on politics"

excerpt: "Dispatch from a moderately prosperous country"
---

It has been striking in the weeks following my time in China to talk to people who know comparatively little about it. I hear again and again questions about China’s political system. *What is it like to live under authoritarianism?* *How do people feel about not having a voice in government?* *How did it feel to be constantly watched by the state?*

I had similar questions when I arrived, and I tried my best to answer them by observing life in China and by talking to ordinary people, students, professors, and more. I don’t believe I was very successful—or at least, I don’t think I got a representative sense of how people thought about the political system. Perhaps the most enduring phenomenon of life in China was how often I felt the need to self-censor myself, to refrain from discussing politically “sensitive” issues. Doing so felt like it required a reserve of courage that I did not possess. Up until the last day I was conflicted about this.

In any case, take this as a single perspective of a diverse and complex country, not a representative story.

### I. True Faith

*“Yan’an is the holy land of revolution.”* 

I’m standing in the Yan’an Revolution Memorial Hall with a group of my twenty classmates on our study abroad program, reading the first placard of the museum. Surrounding me, I see university student groups, old men and women wearing black hats with red stars, officers in the army; they stand beside the colossal statue of Chairman Mao, whose arms stand on his hips, facing a large bridge that closes the gap between two of the large hills that sit across the Yanhe River in Yan’an, Shaan’xi Province.

The city has always been a site of pilgrimage for the old and education for the young. At revolutionary sites, the army officers sit on fold-up chairs beside Mao’s home, nestled in the caves of Yan’an hills, and listen intently to lectures; later they join the old to take selfies in the gathering halls and home areas of the revolutionaries. 

This area was crucial in the Chinese Civil War when the Communists, battered by GMD forces in China’s southeast, made the treacherous journey north known as the Long March to Yan’an, where they set up their headquarters for the rest of the war. It was during this period when Mao inspired admiration for his military strategy and dedication, and ultimately took control of the Party. Lately President Xi has [called upon](https://jamestown.org/yanan-spirit-the-rise-of-xis-lieutenants/) people to “carry forward the Yan’an Spirit,” which he defines in part as “adhering to the firm and correct political direction” and “practicing self-reliance and hard work.” His message seems to be working: outside the memorial hall, a group of coworkers hold a banner which calls upon the group to “revisit the Yan’an Spirit through practical activities” (沈派餐饮重温 ‘延安精神’ 实践活动).

Xi’s effort to reinvigorate patriotism, nationalism, and revolutionary spirit in China extends beyond mere slogans; he knows that communication will be more effective if linked to figures in history that can serve as role models. In that moment I am reminded of an exhibit at the National Museum of China which features more than a hundred of the most lifelike wax figures you will have ever seen in your life. Seriously, they are scarily lifelike:

<div class="gallery-row" style="justify-content: center;">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-2-3">
    <img src="/images/china_3/image%203.png" alt="Two scientists involved in the *Two Bombs, One Satellite* project. I need to find this wax figure company." />
  </figure>
</div>

Two scientists involved in the *Two Bombs, One Satellite* project. I need to find this wax figure company.

The foreword of the exhibit reads, “As Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized, a nation of hope cannot be without heroes,” and the conclusion exhorts museum-goers to “learn from heroes, inherit and carry forward their revolutionary spirit and noble style…and struggle for the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation.” China’s history is increasingly resembling mythology, as Xi deftly pushes to the fore certain figures that are emblematic of ideals that people ought to carry forth.

This campaign of hero construction also encompasses, of course, Xi himself. At the Liangjiahe village, 60 kilometers east of Yan’an, we visit a set of memorials commemorate his seven years working for the village and later rising to serve as its Party leader. As part of the *Down to the Countryside* movement initiated by Mao during the Cultural Revolution, Xi was separated from his family and stayed here, enduring harsh circumstances. The period was a fraught time for his family: his father, once Party loyalty, received an ignominious end after drawing scorn from radical youth; his sister later committed suicide. Yet after his meteoric rise within the Party, Xi has spoken of his time there in largely positive terms, crediting it with opening his eyes to the plight of rural people and allowing him to serve his country better.

<div class="gallery-row">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">

  </figure>

Perhaps surprisingly, the museum is not plastered with photos and quotes of Xi; instead the story of the village’s rise from destitution to prosperity encompasses the larger narrative. Xi is presented as the humble public servant whose time in Liangjiahe opened his eyes to the plight of the common people and enabled him to effectively fulfill the village’s needs. The only quote from Xi, situated at the end of the museum, points to the tremendous progress experienced by Liangjiahe’s residents—access to old-age care, insurance, the Internet—as a microcosm for China’s reform and opening up. Xi remarks, “This made me realize more deeply that the Chinese dream is the people’s dream,” referencing the “Chinese dream” concept that he has pioneered. Across the museum, along the village streets, a propaganda poster reads: “Strive to make life better and better.” Another reads: 

> Love the common people like loving your own parents
Seek benefits for the common people, lead the common people to a better life
>

I believe that the Chinese mode of politics is ultimately about faith. Faith that life will get better and better. Faith in progress. Faith in technology. Faith in the Communist Party.

My professor Dingxin Zhao is a Chicago sociologist who now, semi-retired, runs social sciences research programs at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. He is well-known internationally for his research on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. In his work uncovering the determinants of the largest student movement in history, he found that a framework of the “politics of legitimacy”—i.e., understanding how states gain legitimacy—was useful for understanding Tiananmen and China’s system more broadly.

For Zhao there are three ways that states can gain legitimacy from the people (these are not mutually exclusive, but one usually overrides the others):

1. **Legal-electoral:** states earn trust through democratic institutions. Even when people have little trust in the leaders themselves, the states have legitimacy through procedure.
2. **Ideological:** a state encompasses certain principles, and earns legitimacy based on how much the people believe those principles. Authoritarian regimes are often ideological.
3. **Performance:** the state is legitimized based on its performance, i.e., how well it maintains law and delivers services and material benefits to people. 

For the thousands of years of Chinese civilization, most of the great dynasties operated under this performance-based authoritarian approach. In his sprawling book *China: A New History*, John Fairbanks writes of the cyclical nature of Chinese dynasties: how in their dying breaths, empires would be exposed for their inability to maintain law and order, and how they had relinquished their Mandate of Heaven through their breakdown.

With a brief, if consequential, interruption of ideological fervor during the Mao era, Chinese politics has broadly followed this continuum of politics: performance-based authoritarianism that has ushered in stability that old civilizations like Europe could only have dreamed of.

The contemporary social contract seems simple enough: the Party is a cadre of technocrats tasked with maintaining order and progress. If the people receive order and experience progress, then they will consider the Party legitimate. Otherwise, they will revolt.

This state of affairs has led the Party to become arguably the most progress-obsessed institution in the world. The leaders are always seeking more: more trains, more tourist destinations, more energy, more convenience. When I ride the Beijing Subway, the little screen with CCTV in the corner shows off more and more outlandishly advanced tourist sites: pathways across mountain gaps, giant cable cars, and even elevators carved into mountains. The sheer absurdity of everything almost makes me wonder: do people really want this? [^1]

But as the economy wavers, Xi cannot rest so comfortably on his laurels. Perhaps one can understand the state’s view of its own legitimacy by seeing how much it leans on different levers: in this case, the state is eager to construct an ideological basis for itself, to instill a sense of patriotism and nationalism that can serve as a reserve of faith even when the going gets tough. Much like people believed in Mao’s vision even through the harshness of the Chinese Civil War, Xi wants to achieve a similar faith for himself and the state. Hence, propaganda that promotes the twelve socialist values or glorifies a hegemonic China.

As an example, Yinchuan, in Ningxia Province in China’s northwest, might be perhaps the most propaganda-dense city I have ever seen. The province is home to a substantial portion of China’s Hui Muslim population, but that doesn’t seem to quite explain why there is so much; the Hui are well-known for their assimilation into Han culture. [^2] My professor, who spent many unhappy years here during the *Down to the Countryside* era after being whisked away from Shanghai’s French Concession to a Ningxia factory, tells me that the propaganda is central retribution for a wayward provincial policy. A few years ago, Yinchuan aimed to become the “World Muslim City,” in an attempt to attract investment and tourism from the Middle East. Their efforts extended to building huge mosques in the hinterland and adding Arabic to the street signs. Once the central government caught wind of the scheme, they put an end to it.

These are the sort of political dynamics that undergird the Communist Party, which is less an absolute dictatorship and more obeys the logic of provincial competition under central primacy. Gradually provincial autonomy is being subordinated to central authority under Xi’s regime, which has given a kind of homogeneity and *sameness* to China that I suspect was not the case in previous decades. To give the case of urban design: among Chinese cities that I have visited, the only one that has truly shocked me in its profound differences from the rest of China is Chongqing. 

Yes, centralization is now the defining force driving politics, and it extends to a consolidation of Xi’s authority himself. One cannot escape Xi’s quotes, which grace the walls of even my university campus. All museums feature numerous quotes and images of Xi, something which did not used to be the case with previous presidents of China. And social media censorship, especially with regard to Xi, is still widespread.

### II. Temptation

The trajectory of Chinese modern political history appears to me like a Shakespearean tragedy. It is evident that that something was suffocated in 1989, an instinct for activism and dissent that was pervasive across the nation’s universities. At the same time as the economy opened up, a political future was foreclosed.

In my professor’s book, *The Power of Tiananmen*, considered the definitive treatment of the movement and massacre, he describes the changes that were occurring across state and society. In the mid-1980s, the state began its transition from an ideological, revolutionary regime to a performance-based one; one consequence of this was its less hardline attitude towards ideological dissent. At the same time, the beginnings of the Reform and Opening Up period had produced profound confusion and anxiety. A term was coined, *shiheng*, to describe the feeling of “losing one’s balance.” Corruption was rampant, rural-urban migration had created chaos in the cities, and many had grievances due to uncertainty for the future and envy for those who had benefitted more from reforms.

In the midst of this turbulent period was born a diverse social and cultural movement that came to be known as the New Enlightenment. Major figures of the movement opposed the Cultural Revolution and its atrocities; Ba Jin famously called upon Chinese society to establish Cultural Revolution museums [^3]. Fifth generation filmmakers like Zhang Yimou released “enlightening” films that covertly critiqued the current state of affairs. The famous TV show *River Elegy* criticized traditional Chinese values.

The discourse in universities was even more rich. The political control system in universities, enforced by Party officials and volunteers embedded in classes and administration, began to unravel as the legitimacy of the state declined. Students started discussing political matters in dormitories. Political conferences were frequently held on Beijing campuses (a phenomenon known as “conference fever”). Small-scale study groups like Wang Dan’s Democracy Salon brought together many of the leading figures of the New Enlightenment, like Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian; intermittent protests occurred near continuously prior to the Tiananmen Square movement. Student radicals wrote big-character posters that linked various “social ills” with the lack of democracy. Zhao writes of one example in early 1989:

> On March 1, a big-character poster entitled “Down with Deng—A Memorandum to the Whole Nation” appeared at Beijing University as well as other universities. It argued that “communist politics equals empty talk, the power of the mighty, authoritarianism, arbitrariness, and power greater than the law. Therefore, party domination and the Four Cardinal Principles must be abolished.”
> 

These movements coalesced into the 1989 Tiananmen protests, an event whose simple scale and content shock me to this day. It is hard for me not to pass the square and think about the three students who knelt in front of Li Peng's office, holding the petition above their head and crying, begging him to receive it, or the huge statue of the Goddess of Democracy in the square’s center. The ensuing massacre ended the movement less with a bang and more with a whimper: with kids killed indiscriminately in the streets rather than in the square itself.

Political dissent was not completely stifled following Deng's post-1989 repression, but it gradually withered away. In intellectual discourse today, we see less of the messy clash of values; everything is oriented towards a quasi-nationalistic perspective, an approach to thinking about *how we can make the country better*? Less liberals vs. conservatives, more pragmatism and centrism. Less ideology, more building trains, improving healthcare, strengthening the military, increasing economic growth. [^4]

In the absence of real democratic processes, what alternatives have sprouted? Under the banner of “whole process people’s democracy,” the CCP is attempting to find ways to include the voices of the people in the political process:

</div>

One thing I was struck by in conversations with students today was their reticence in discussing politics; how every time we lurched close to a "sensitive" topic, even one that didn't precisely concern China, they would hang their heads or grimace.

To give one example, I spoke with a student at Beijing Foreign Affairs University who was studying international relations. We spoke about college life in the US, and I mentioned the large pro-Palestinian protests. She asked if I participated; I told her no, and she said she was glad ("it will distract from academics"). I asked if there was anything like that on her campus, and she shook her head vigorously and changed the topic. [^5] Later we got to discussing the usage of VPN (most of her classmates don't use one, but many English students do). I asked her what she thought of the Great Firewall, and she sort of grimaced. "You know, it's politics, and we really shouldn't talk about it here," she told me. We were sitting in a regular dining hall.

It is not surprising to see apolitical people, per se; an average cab driver in the US is not much more political than one in China. But when students, of all people, are so uniformly apolitical, it suggests that something permanent has occurred. Indeed, I have never seen a country so devoid of outward politics. It all exists and operates out of mind.

Indeed, that is the surprising thing about Chinese authoritarianism: the way it operates out of sight, such that you don't even realize the awesome power of the state. In the US our president  sending the armed National Guard to American cities; meanwhile in China, police officers never carry guns and there are few displays of state power, even in the capital. After a while, you start to forget the existence of the state in the first place. Perhaps that is by design.

### III. Dreams Never End

Let me tell you about one more conversation, which I had with my English-speaking tour guides. It was our last day in Yan’an, and we stood on the Bao’ta Mountain, which has a large pagoda with revolutionary significance at the top. The sun was strong that day, dampening the chilling effect of the northern China winds. Tourist groups shuttled back and forth.

I first asked about Mao’s legacy—how the Chinese are able to reconcile Mao’s dramatic achievement of unifying China with the horrors of his domestic policy, in which millions of Chinese people were killed under disastrous socialist policies and revolutionary activities. That is, Mao himself seemed okay with the idea of being “70% correct, 30% wrong”—indeed, this is official Party doctrine—but the 30% wrong seems so bad that it is difficult to fully accept this.

Both of them acknowledged the hard time during the Great Leap Forward, but believe that Mao was ultimately a good leader confronted with two difficulties: (1) a drought spreading through the country, one responsible for many of the deaths, and (2) the fact that he received incorrect information about the GLF and was unable to act. He had the best interests of the country in mind but could not surmount these two difficulties. I told them that Mao was clearly aware of the disastrous effects of the GLF, and had even had Peng Dehuai purged after he brought up some of his shortcomings. Harvey responded with a shrug—”you know, it’s also politics, you have to build a country, to show the people that they can have faith in you.” To me, this is a striking observation about the worthlessness of human life under Mao, how millions could be extinguished to ensure that Mao’s nation-building project persists.

On the Cultural Revolution, they placed blame mostly on the Gang of Four and the Red Guards for the CR’s excesses, which also killed untold amounts of people, while praising other aspects of the revolution, like the “Down to the Countryside” movement. I told them that Mao certainly takes some blame for the more violent aspects of the revolution and could have put a stop to it if he wanted, but they seemed to brush it aside. I told them that while I supported some aspects of the DTC policy, it seems like it obviously inflicted a lot of pain; in fact Xi had remarked on it being a sad and difficult time for him. They acknowledged it as a necessary pain, one that made the country stronger. Zoey later said: “Many of our second-generation leaders are corrupt because they did not have to go through this process, because they were not involved in building the country. Xi is unique because he had to go through this process.”

What do people think of Xi? “Xi is a great president, maybe the best since Mao.” “Corruption was everywhere in China, but Xi put a stop to it. Every day we would look at the papers and see two more officials removed for corruption.” “Many of the rich restaurants and hotels closed down because the corrupt officials, who used to have a lot of money, stopped going there because they were removed.”

I pushed back, mentioning some the hardline zero-COVID policies that sequestered people for months in their homes, sometimes without access to food. They didn’t understand why it might be thought of as draconian; in fact, they felt good that they were being protected and it was good that so many people didn’t die. To the extent that people were going hungry, they tell me that it was a marginal experience—and that those who suffered were to blame for a lot of those issues (”you have to be able to cook for yourself, right?”). 

“If the government does something you don’t like,” I asked, “do you feel like you can raise your voice and say something?” Once again, they seemed to not quite understand; why raise our voice if nothing is wrong? They possess a tremendous faith in government, one supported by evidence of the government continuing to support people through hardship. The floods in China in the early-2000s were awful, and many people died, but they had faith that the government would figure out the issue and correct it. The government did. So to the extent that there are problems, they know that the government will fix them, and so there is no need to have a voice in the political process. [^6]

This extends further. The “70% correct, 30% wrong” doctrine seems broadly to be how they think about the government at all. Governments do bad things, of course, but they have experienced such progress and wealth that they still have faith in it and don’t want things to change, even if they do not like certain aspects. In a particularly striking statement, Harvey tells me: Western media portrays the Chinese people as brainwashed, but they aren’t brainwashed. Many people know what is happening to the Uyghurs (”Eastern Turkey?”) and aren’t happy with it, for instance, but on the whole if the government continues to support and benefit them, it is okay.

I stare out into the sun-drenched hills of Shaan’xi, watching the happy tourists flitter about without a care in the world. They smile and take selfies. In that moment I think that we are all  more similar than different.

---

How ought we to project the future of the Communist Party and China?

The most surprising (and perhaps troubling) implication of Zhao’s analysis is that revolution tends to accompany a period of weakening repression, rather than full repression. Xi’s regime represents the most repressive instantiation of the Party since the Mao era, and we should expect it to remain full intact if repression continues. This doesn’t mean that protests will not occur—as we saw during COVID-19—but that such protests will not be as earth-shaking as the  Tiananmen Square movement was.

If we want to understand the frontier of CCP repression, Hong Kong is a good place to visit. On the eve of the legislative council elections, my cab driver tells me that he doesn’t plan to vote; all of the candidates are grifters who take your money. There is less freedom under Chinese rule; at least under the British, he tells me, they took our money but left us alone. There is a sadness to the flurry of LegCo election posters on the streets, where the opposition party is disbanded and only pro-Beijing candidates are left.

I’m not sure about the future, but ultimately I keep returning back to that village in Yan’an where Xi spent seven long years in hard labor to understand the Party’s direction under Xi.

Walking through Liangjiahe, we learn that Xi is clearly not interested in building the same kind of cult of personality as Mao. Certainly both are interested in consolidating power and serving as visible leaders for the party, rather than hiding in the background. Both of their messages seem to emphasize continuous struggle, although Xi’s struggle embodies much more a culture of relentless persistence and dedication towards national rejuvenation than the chaos of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. 

Xi’s cult, if it can be called that, portrays him as a fatherly figure, gently tending to his children (“common people”), who must trust in his wisdom to guide them away from laziness and capitalistic decadence and towards progress, power, and national rejuvenation. Most importantly, the people must never forget what the Party has done for them, and trust in them once more to continue bringing improvements to their lives. One can see even here the religious overtones of Party history and propaganda, where freedom and individuality are subordinated to faith and conviction, with one ultimate imperative: *always follow the Party*.

[^1]: Revealed preference in China’s premier tourist sites (read: huge crowds) would lead me to believe that the answer is yes. 

[^2]: By way of my DiDi driver: “I read on the news about the issues of religion in India. We have very good relations with ethnic minorities in China.”

[^3]: I would be remiss not to mention that the Cultural Revolution gets barely a mention in most museums of today, and when it does, blame is ascribed to the Gang of Four and not Mao.

[^4]: For some context on this, I looked at some of the academic publications and think tank research produced at Renmin University. One gets the sense that a lot of the public policy work is oriented towards persuasion, and emerges from less of an ideological lens.

[^5]: My professor tells me that pro-Palestinian activism does exist, but mostly on social media. Most of the activists didn’t feel like they should protest in public.

[^6]: This to me seems to indicate that perhaps one issue in the late-1980s reforms was a lack of faith that government would deliver material improvements in people’s lives, and that this faith was built in the ‘90s and 2000s when life kept getting better.
