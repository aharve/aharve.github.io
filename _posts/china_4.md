Here are some of my favorite memories, in no particular order:

- Clubbing in Suzhou with a bunch of college students, where we played a series of absurd drinking games and may have almost gotten scammed
- Playing (and winning!) mahjong in the middle of the night at a 24-hour spot in Fuzhou. Mahjong is great because it combines both strategy and speed.
- Long train travel is wonderful. I particularly enjoyed a stretch of HSR from Zhangye, in Gansu Province, through Qinghai and then back to Gansu to Shaan’xi. The scenery, with snow-capped mountains and alien deserts, was something to behold.
- Wandering around the French Concession late at night in Shanghai and sharing a drink with a generous foreigner, whose financial backing is a bit mysterious. The nights are just so good in Shanghai.
- Celebrating my birthday at Heidilao in Yan’an , where I got to witness an implausibly extravagant celebration by the staff, involving a masked man throwing goodies at me, a group of employees holding the Chinese characters for “birthday” and dancing, and an elaborate plastic cake
- After making friends with them, part-time security guards at Beihai Park during Golden Week just take off all of their police outfits and do a Douyin dance for us
- Watching kids absolutely lose their minds when they see a foreigner. On one walk through Baotou a group of kids on a field trip to the Baotou Museums shouted all at once *wai guo ren!* (foreigner). I gave them all high-fives.
- Speaking my regional language (Kannada) with two Indians from my hometown in an electronics market in Shenzhen, where they were buying equipment for their company
- My almost-missing the train to Beijing from Zhengding Airport (after spending the night on an airport bench), then having the train staff scramble to get me on a train
- Biking around West Lake in Hangzhou listening to the Beatles. Pure bliss.

Here are some of my favorite photos:

And here are various sketches/observations:

**The economy**. “Beijing is exhausting,” my cab driver tells me on my last DiDi ride in the city. Here, 12-hour days and multiple jobs are not uncommon, and despite the fact that regulations have limited the percentage cut taken by rideshare companies, wages are still painfully low. It is a phenomenon mirrored across the country, where prices are sliding further and further down along with wages—while some goods like Beijing real estate remain improbably high. The economic slowdown is very much a real phenomenon, but not one that can be felt as easily from visually observing the country (at least, apart from places like Tianjin, where gigantic unfinished skyscrapers are solemn memorials to a frenetic chapter in Chinese real estate).

I like talking to Chinese students and young grads about their dreams. My friend **Jiahao** wanted to become an academic and study Chinese economic history, but barely missed the test cutoff for Tsinghua; now he builds his startup and studies economics at *Beida*. **Xinyi** wanted to go into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but she let it go; they accept very few women, apparently because they can't handle war placements. Now she’s trying to go abroad to study international relations. **Haoran** wanted to further his humanities studies in China after completing a Master’s abroad, but the job market is too hard; he now helps manage a fancy Beijing mall. **Yuexi** wants to be a war journalist and **Jingyi** wants to study law in Hong Kong. **Ruoxi** wants to work on social journalism to address women's rights, rising youth unemployment, and the plight of migrant workers.

It’s just too hard to get jobs in China, one student tells me, and the kids are not all right. Life is a frenetic race to get into good schools, and it takes a tremendous and underdiscussed mental health toll. If you are a STEM graduate, you are competing with more and more students for fewer and fewer jobs; and if you are a humanities or social sciences grad, forget about a traditional job. The default path seems to be furthering one’s education (either in China or abroad), getting a job *in education*, or just finding what you can get (a path that has led some college graduates to join the vaunted ranks of China’s gig economy army).

Some students prefer to escape from the stratospheric expectations of life entirely. In Yunnan, a sunny and temperate province in China’s southwest, we meet a girl from Shaan’xi who has been living and traveling in the province for months. She tells us that she was an economics graduate from Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, one of the best universities in the country; now, she splits her time between travel here and running a hotel in Hainan. She jokes that she feels old, outnumbered by 18- and 19-year olds. And she mentions a word, *lüjū* (旅居). *To live in another place for a long period of time.* Indeed, she has no plans of returning back to traditional life.

**Life in lower-tier cities and the countryside**. China is quite prosperous, but clearly there is a veneer that exists in the tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai. I saw plenty of places in the outer reaches of Beijing that could be classified as dilapidated, cramped living conditions with limited services. Of course, many of these places were in the process of being demolished to make way for cookie-cutter high rises that typify modern Chinese construction.

Outside of tier 1 cities, these kinds of developments are more common, especially in rural areas. I saw an abundance of these houses on the *Gaotie* through Gansu Province, which is one of China’s poorest provinces. Many of the more crowded, underdeveloped areas are hidden away by big walls that divide the *Gaotie* (I imagine this is mainly to reduce noise).

I visited a rural village in Fujian Province, about 120km from the capital and 20km from a small city (in Gutian County). I was able to get there with the *Gaotie*; this stretch is a particular engineering marvel, cut through endless mountains. The station is ten minutes away from the village, and was built just over ten years ago.

The experience was eerie: the only people I saw were very young children and old people, who simply stared at me without making any conversation. Some farmed; others were simply sitting and passing the time. A disheveled man wanders around, mumbling aimlessly; when I get close, he nearly lashes out at me with a cigarette in his hand. At the Xiayang Village Party Committee Hall, I hear loud music and ask a man what is going on in broken Chinese; he shakes his head and moves away. The air smells like chocolate.

I finally speak to a middle-aged lady who runs a convenience store out of her house. She tells me that this village has just about one thousand people, and that most are descended from the same ancient *Shi* family. Nevertheless, many young people have moved to the cities; her own husband works in Xinjiang and comes back rarely. I ask her about mobile connectivity and the facilities, and she tells me that all of the amenities of life are good. However, I hear from Chinese-origin friends that other villages in China can lack heating or running water. [^1]

**Beijing**. I confess that I didn’t spend *as much* time traveling around Beijing as I should have. I like this place a lot, though. The Beijing Subway is a beast—the largest metro network in the world, it has a dense grid of interlocking lines that means that any stop is usually at most two transfers away, without having to go into the city center. I think it’s the best metro I have ever used in my life, with the only con being that transfer times between lines can be very long, due to the poor in-station design.

Compared to a city like Shanghai, there is not as much to do in the way of recreation. Three-quarters of the year, the weather is lousy, which means that going out to the mountains can be difficult. There are plenty of bars and clubs, many of them nestled in the *hutong* districts; a fun activity is just to wander around these areas. There are lots of pretty, landscaped Qing areas like the Summer Palace or Peking/Tsinghua campuses; you can also visit the traditional areas like the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, which are both excellent. 

Like a lot of China, a classic activity of recreation is going to malls. Fortunately, this is much more fun than in the US, because Chinese malls have all kinds of crazy things, like:
go-karting, video games, massage chairs, claw machines, i.e., legalized gambling for children, interactive VR games, the game Go with a robot at Toys ‘r Us, cute pets in questionable conditions, fashion runway photo shoot shops, model car shop where you can actually race the cars, *actual* car shops, where you can sit inside fancy EVs with reclining chairs that massage you, KTV, i.e., 24-hour karaoke, and more.

In general, Beijing is more stodgy and serious than its southern neighbors (with the exception of its people, who are uniformly hilarious). Don’t expect night markets (or any street food stalls, really) or a really energetic nightlife scene. The pleasures of Beijing seem to be more intellectual and cultural. I’m not sure there’s a place I would rather be.

My favorite parks were Zizhuyuan Park in Haidian, or the Summer Palace. As a vegetarian, my food options were limited, but I loved *jianbing*, *liangpi*, and gluten skewers. My least favorite part was the pollution. I assume it is vastly less than it used to be, but many autumn days were still accompanied by a gross, cough-inducing haze.

**Electric vehicles**. Coolest looking one: any car by Xiaomi, with honorable mentions for Nio and Zeekr. Fanciest car: Li Auto, which had the reclining seats and massage chairs. Honorable mention to all the cars where you can just tap the car handle and it will open automatically. Most disappointing: BYDs, which I thought were the cutting-edge of Chinese EVs but they are actually the budget variety. It is cool that they are so cheap, though.

**International students**. There were many international students in Beijing! I made friends with people from southeast Asia, Pakistan, Uganda (and other African countries), Korea, the Middle East, and even South America (I met a few Colombians). I would end up doing a deep-dive on this for my Chinese foreign policy class, and learned about some strategies that Chinese universities are undertaking to attract foreign students (much of it under the auspices of the Belt and Road Initative). The amount of international students is skyrocketing due to the quality and affordability of the education. You can read more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11FWRmohyjxsqKA6QYUHalsmbEzrDYLDIajjglcm7PsI/edit?tab=t.0).

**Various other curiosities and delights of life.** (1) little TVs in all kinds of vehicles, (2) undocked, abundant bikeshare (and moped-share!), (3) rent chargers for short periods of time, return anywhere, (4) why does everyone here have the same roller suitcase?, (5) the sheer incredibleness of Alipay and WeChat, (6) all of the many T-shirts with broken English; (7) the fact that all metro systems in China look the same and use Alipay for transport

**The future.** There are three great cyberpunk cities in China: Chongqing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Here are some photos on Chongqing:

I’ve been thinking about China’s futurism aesthetic, particularly after visiting Japan. My theory is that Japanese futurism, in broad strokes, is centered around one fundamental question: *how can we make your life more delightful*? This is a question that can be answered through relentless cycles of hyper-capitalism, which has resulted in a preponderance of interesting, quirky activities that one can pursue, and a built environment (through big, neon-drenched shopping districts and speedy Shinkansen trains) that supports this.

China asks a different question: *how can we make your life more awe-inspiring?* Chinese capital flows are deployed to a produce an aesthetic that seeks to overwhelm you with its grandeur: huge, monumental train stations; beautiful, gleaming skyscrapers; superfast trains and monumental, grand apartment blocks. It reminds me a lot of the aesthetic that once defined the Gilded Age and Progressive Era: an age of European-inspired grandeur, huge public works projects, and unique faith in science and technology. Coming back to Chicago and seeing the products of this era, like majestic Union Station, the grand apartment building complexes in Hyde Park, and the soaring skyscrapers along the river, I am reminded of China, which seems to be hurtling through a similar time. As one small example, I took many photos of entrances to apartment block complexes, which exemplify this aesthetic in their own goofy way:

<div class="gallery-row">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">
    <img src="/images/china_4/image%2022.png" alt="image.png" />

  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">

  </figure>
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">
    <img src="/images/china_4/image%2025.png" alt="image.png" />
  </figure>
</div>

China resembles the Progressive Era in more ways than architecture. It is famously one of the [most](https://www.notion.so/Blog-post-4-2ded3e83641180bfb8c3cd5da1d80c23?pvs=21) techno-optimistic country in the world, and it has eagerly grasped onto and integrated emerging technology into life in ways that can often be a little silly. Few museums and historic areas lack a VR component; many also feature a virtual AI guide, or a tiny little robot that accompanies you around the hall. Outside the museum, you might get a drink at a robo-vending machine, which can even feature a full humanoid robot serving you a drink! I’ve seen *tons* of ads about AI, many of them very silly things like AI toothbrushes and automated AI tutors. [^2] 

<div class="gallery-row">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-1">
    <img src="/images/china_4/image%2026.png" alt="image.png" />
  </figure>
</div>

These are the most common instantiations of high technology. This is partly why articles about “futuristic” China seem a bit misleading to me, like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/17/climate/china-hefei-clean-energy-drones-evs-robots.html?searchResultPosition=1) one. The vast, vast majority of people are not encountering flying cars or even driverless cars; Waymo has earned much more diffusion in the US than any driverless company in China, where labor costs are so low that such technology is unnecessary. Drone delivery (or even robot delivery) is still more curiosity than commonly used, where, once again, labor costs are low enough that Meituan drivers can ferry around anything while earning peanuts. The most futuristic aspects of China are in its transportation and infrastructure, particularly China high-speed rail. [^3]

If we want to understand the aesthetic and philosophical dimensions of the Chinese future, Shenzhen is a good place to go to. A former fishing village turned modern metropolis, the city perhaps best represents the visions of Chinese state planners, as well as good place to understand the psyche, and moral convictions, of a country as it entered capitalist transformation in the Reform and Opening Up era.

With regards to its technological future, I was struck by two ads in the Shenzhen Metro:

<div class="gallery-row">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">
    <img src="/images/china_4/image%2027.png" alt="image.png" />
  </figure>
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">
    <img src="/images/china_4/image%2028.png" alt="image.png" />
  </figure>
</div>

Both of them are by the Shenzhen Gas Corporation, a major Chinese energy company, and feature the tagline “Let life undergo a *smart* transition” (让生活发生智变). Both have AI-generated images that depict the future; the first features a little bubble that says, “*Let big-sister robot take us on an adventure together!”,* while the second has a tagline that says, “*In the morning, AI curtains automatically adjust the incoming light. The coffee machine understands your fatigue level, and a latte at just the right temperature is ready.*” 

Perhaps we shouldn’t over-analyze an ad too much, but the idea of the future clearly is that technologies like AI and robotics will bring delight to our lives and make our lives much more convenient and comfortable. In contrast to the US, where AI is bound up with anxieties with the future, these ads seem to be embracing a positive vision of the future. And indeed, I was surprised to not hear much anxiety about “AI taking jobs” among people I talked to. When I mentioned the jobs worry to one fellow, he replied, “That’s okay. We’re all going to become a silicon-based civilization eventually, this is sort of a passing phase that we are living through.”

Well, I guess we can look forward to that.

**The past?**

On my last DiDi ride in China, I took a cab from Shenzhen’s Huaqingbei electronics market—this sprawling mess of individual electronics shops selling all kinds of crazy tools and devices—to the Shekou Port, en route to Macau. My cab driver, who I attempted to make conversation with, had the thickest Guangdong accent ever. Even my trusty AI translation companion was struggling as he talked.

So I didn’t learn too much, besides the fact that he came here (like everyone else) from somewhere else. I asked him my classic question with my limited Chinese: *Ni xi huan Shenzhen?* Do you like Shenzhen? And he responded, as virtually everyone I have asked this question has responded: “Like? Don’t like? It’s where I live!”

Maybe I shouldn’t read too much into it, but I couldn’t help thinking it was a reflection on the relentless pragmatism of Chinese people. It’s not about liking—it’s about making a living.

These days in Shenzhen, more people are liking and living. At least, that is my sense of it as I bike along the parks in Futian District, these glorious green fields next to giant skyscrapers. People are laughing; children are rolling on the ground; buskers are playing rock music; kites are flying. The sun is shining; the day is perfect.

It wasn’t always like this, of course, and it took a lot of effort to get to this point. At the entrance to the Shekou Free Trade Zone, once of the first in the country, is a slogan: “Time is money, efficiency is life.” At the Shenzhen Urban Planning Museum, you see it as well:

<div class="gallery-row" style="justify-content: center;">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-2-3">
    <img src="/images/china_4/image%2029.png" alt="image.png" />
  </figure>
</div>

*Time is money, efficiency is life*. Much like the Mao era, the Reform and Opening Up era is dappled with mythos, and no figure is more mythical (or more prominent in Shenzhen) than Deng Xiaoping. His slogans, like cat theory (”it doesn’t matter whether a cat catches black or white mice, as long as they are mice”) or his approach to economic policy, “crossing the river while feeling the stones,” are legendary.

The museum has two parts: one with English captions, which in a very sleek and stylish ways describes Shenzhen’s present and future, and one in just Chinese, which is more of a great memorial to Reform and Opening Up. Here are some photos:

As I left Shenzhen (and China) for the final time, on a boat en route to the SAR Macau, I couldn’t help but think of a single statement. After reading and hearing about the state of abject poverty in this country, and after traveling around everywhere, I have still seen people struggle and live in poor circumstances. The utopian China portrayed in social media is a far cry from the reality for hundreds of millions.

But Shenzhen for me represents something optimistic and forward-looking. It exists as kind of a historic bridge between this situation and the future; a symbol of the titanic efforts of Chinese people to lift themselves out of poverty through ingeniousness and relentless hard work. I kept thinking back to those pictures of men standing on the hills around the city, their arms on their hips or behind their backs, staring out at the vast expanse of land, and demanding that the work be done faster. Were they even thinking about the future, or were their minds trained to be uncompromisingly pragmatic? How could they have truly envisioned the world they would create?

And so as I left Shenzhen, only a single thought came to mind. *Life has gotten so good.*

[^1]: One other detail I like about this story is that, while meeting the lady in the shop, she helped me get a bus back to the train station. It turns out that these tiny green microbuses run along the highway, shuttling people between the villages. It was a lot of fun to drive in.

[^2]: An interesting factoid about China was its “Double Reduction” private tutoring crackdown, which prohibited for-profit private tutoring in an effort to ease academic pressure and reduce costs for parents. Private tutoring software and hardware is sold everywhere now, and one can imagine companies leveraging AI also benefitting from this policy change.

[^3]: I only came across one drone delivery platform, on the top of the Great Wall.
