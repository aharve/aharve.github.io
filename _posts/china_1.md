Before I left the US for China—like, ten minutes before my flight took off—I finished and published a piece on US-China relations that I had worked feverishly on for the last month and a half. It was my attempt to summarize my beliefs and answer fundamental questions about *why* exactly these two great powers were engaged in competition, and why so many elites were terrified about the impending “Chinese century” and the decline of American hegemony. 

At the same time, I was lucky to work in a think tank that summer with deep expertise in China. My direct colleagues were passionate scholars, rigorous and balanced, and they made a strong effort to help me understand China, not only from a narrow geopolitical lens, but also from a cultural, political, and economic one. Soon after I settled in, I was given a stack of books (”here’s your homework,” my supervisor told me) and resources to learn more. I read Edward Wong’s *At the Edge of Empire* and Tai Ming Cheung’s *Techno-Security State* on long bus rides across the El Camino Real to work; attended history seminars; and had fruitful conversations with colleagues about the country.

All this is to say that, as I boarded my 14-hour flight to Hong Kong, en route to Beijing (my home for the next three months or so), lounging happily in my seat with my 7000-word long blog post published in front of me: I thought I understood China well.

That should have made me happy, but, me being the weird person I am, I quickly felt overcome with dread and anxiety. *What was the point of this?* I wondered. *How much can I really learn on-the-ground in this country? How much can I really learn with a significant language barrier?* 

These worries were swirling in my mind as I touched down in Beijing in late September. My first few days were marred by dread and uncertainty, frequent miscommunications, jet lag, cloudy skies, and a general feeling of dislocation.

The ice finally thawed, of course. I learned the basics of the language; made friends; began traveling on my own. I became accustomed to the rhythm of conversation, grew fond of the often warm and hilarious personalities of people (and kids!), and soon found an unlikely appeal to the often overwhelming and isolating qualities of many Chinese cities. 

At the same time I began to take more agency in my time there. I found myself compelled by the frontier cities of China’s north and northwest, where the autumns are splendid and the people are some of the friendliest you will ever meet, and would end up making multiple trips to those areas. 

I also tried my best to answer some of the deep, prevailing questions that I had been pondering for some time; questions about technology, progress, politics, and culture. In particular I began to fashion myself as a journalist of AI, and got to work trying to document how individuals and the state perceive this nascent technology, which is especially unique among emerging technologies in its world-changing potential and social imaginaries. That beat would end up taking me into the heart of Beijing’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, and meet a cast of characters with relentless enthusiasm for the present and big dreams for the future.

Only in my last few weeks in the country was I struck by questions that I had perilously little to no time to answer. When I left Beijing, I was overwhelmed by this sadness that, in many ways, the big questions I had wanted to figure out had only received scant answers. 

I’m not sure what to make of this, but all I know is that there is tremendous importance to visiting this place. I am reminded of a conversation in Beijing with an important writer in a Chinese think tank, who is accustomed to engaging with Western and Chinese policymakers alike. “The major problem with Western discourse,” he tells me, “is that there is a profound lack of empathy for the Chinese people.” China is considered as simply “the Party” by American policy makers even as their decisions affect Chinese *people*, the vast majority of whom have positive impressions of the US and Americans, and who stand to be harmed by American policy.

If there is one simple thing I am left with on this trip, it is this empathy. It is an empathy that comes from conversations with Chinese people from all walks of life. How it caches out in pure policymaking, I am unsure. But certainly it has transformed China from an amorphous one-party state blob to something much more strange, complex, and deeply human.

Ok, now onto the guide! 

There are plenty of resources for some of the basic ways to get situated, like how to set up Alipay and WeChat, the apps that will contain your entire life. Other useful apps: Meituan (food delivery, fast “anything” delivery), Dianping (Yelp equivalent, for food), Taobao (Amazon equivalent), JD.com (Amazon equivalent, faster delivery perhaps). I found LetsVPN to be consistently reliable for VPN use.

I’ll only add a couple of suggestions here that I would have found helpful upon arrival:

**Travel (transit + accommodations):** 

The best way to get around the country is trains (for shorter distances) and planes (for longer distances). Just use Skyscanner or any other service of your choice for planes. For trains, the best choice is **Trip.com**, which provides an incredibly easy way to purchase and change train tickets in English, at the cost of an (in my opinion) egregious booking fee appended to every train. I tried to use **Railway 12306** on Alipay, but it didn’t work; unless you are in China for a truly extended period of time and plan to travel constantly, I would recommend just sticking with Trip.com

People love to talk about China’s high-speed rail, and yes it is truly marvelous. At the same time, it can often be expensive, sometimes costing more than a plane ticket, especially for high-usage lines like Beijing-Shanghai. Because of this, for budget travelers I recommend purchasing *sleeper trains* to get across far distances. The important thing you need to know about this is that these trains run out fast, partly because they are so cheap: because of this, you should plan your travel out in advance and book them ahead of time (the earliest is two weeks). Sleeper trains can be an uncomfortable experience, but it is perhaps more fun than HSR. One weekend I made it all the way to western Gansu province (Zhangye) on two consecutive sleeper trains, bumming it in the top bunk with some guys going all the way to Xinjiang (who insisted that I was from Pakistan).

This is a great time to travel in China partly because of how affordable everything is (for comparatively high quality). Accommodations are unbelievably cheap—I had a whole room to myself in a hotel in Chongqing’s central district for $10. Getting around the city is easy and affordable thanks to Didi, the country’s equivalent of Uber. And most importantly, as far as I know there is zero issue of safety.

**Translation:**

Talking to Chinese people is the best part of traveling through China, so of course it is best if you speak Chinese. I wish I had made more of an effort to learn before arriving in Beijing. I was intimidated by the language, but I now believe it is quite easy to level-up rapidly and speak at a basic level with knowledge of the tones, basic phrases, and a bit of persistence.

Using translators (constantly) in China taught me a lot about the psychology of conversation. First, initiating a conversation is much easier if you have some basic phrases at hand. My go-to one for virtually everyone, if I didn’t have some observation myself, was, *Ni shi na li ren* (Where are you from)? Often I would be asked where I was from as well. [^1] Once the conversation got going and I had run out of phrases, I would whip out my translator to ask something I didn’t know how to say. Through this, I ended up having some very nice conversations with people, although I did feel that there was a substantial barrier that existed due to language differences. I think I would have been able to connect with people on a much deeper level if I truly knew Chinese. For this reason, I would recommend trying to level-up as much on Chinese as possible if you don’t know it; it’s worth it.

I rotated through multiple translation apps but didn’t find one that I loved. Traditional translate apps like Google Translate and Microsoft Translator work well for basic, practical conversations, but less well for real dialogue. The transcription is poor and the translations are stilted. AI translators are more capable [^2], but inference speeds are slow, and if their total context window is small, I’ve found that they often tend to “forget” that they are translators midway through a conversation.

Ultimately, the best one I found was **Yuanbao**, an AI app by Tencent that uses Deepseek. It is on Android, but I am not sure if it is on iOS. This one is good because inference is relatively fast and it is easy to press and hold for recording speech. It suffers from this “forgetting” problem though, so every so often I would have to reuse the prompt and create multiple instances. But it’s great at transcription and the translations are accurate (the one exception being my DiDi driver in Shenzhen, who spoke in a thick Guangdong accent of which Yuanbao could only decipher pieces). For extended, one-on-one conversations, I recommend **ChatGPT Voice Mode**, which can be difficult to use on-the-fly but when it works is very solid.

**Where should you travel?:**

I’ll have more to say on the specifics of places I went over China. In total I went to 14 provinces and four prefecture-level cities, along with Hong Kong and Macau. I went to every region except Northeast China (and arguably Central China, although technically I’ve been to Hunan) and the far west (Xinjiang, Tibet). 

Before you decide where to travel, it is important to understand *why* you want to travel. Different people will have different reasons. For me, I wasn’t sure. Certain areas, whether due to their history/culture/design, fascinated me: the cyberpunk landscape of Chongqing, the ethnic diversity of Yunnan, the traditional landscape of Hangzhou. Others were more random picks, chosen more to just see a new side of the country rather than any particular location.

One thing I’ve heard is that China is homogenous: apart from differences in food or dialect, the cities generally look similar, or the tourist sites all feel the same. I agree that at a superficial level it is relatively homogenous, and that compared to a super-diverse area like Europe or India, it probably does not reach that same level.

At the same time, each region does have its own particular history or culture that makes it interesting: cosmopolitan Shanghai, Fujian Province’s intertwined relationship with Taiwan, the north and northeastern “Rust Belt”, the technological power of Shenzhen, the alien landscapes of the northwest. And insofar as China the state is complex, you will learn about different aspects of it on trips across the country: by visiting city or provincial museums, for example, or by reading the propaganda on various streets. Certain tourist destinations are also quite revealing of Chinese culture and state machinations.

With this in mind, here are my favorite destinations in China:

1. Chongqing: Go here to be smacked on the head with the mind-boggling speed of Chinese progress. It is a true cyberpunk city: electric skyscrapers, trains whooshing through buildings and mountains, improbably large bridges. I was also struck by how different it is from other Chinese cities in urban form: it feels more like a Tokyo than a Beijing, so go here after having spent some time seeing other cities.
2. Yunnan (Kunming, Dali, Lijiang): Yunnan Province has been rightly praised; it is one of the few areas that I think I could keep coming back to. The slower pace of life and beautiful surroundings in pristine weather is a welcome change, and it is partly why so many Chinese people choose to move there. You can only scratch the surface on a short trip—and much of its charm lies far away from high-speed rail stations—but Dali and Lijiang were incredible. Tiger Leaping Gorge might be the best hike I’ve ever been on.
3. Beijing: I like Dan Wang’s quip that Beijing is interesting in the sheer scale of its ugliness. I contend, though, that the Soviet-style blocks and wide avenues have their charm. Of course, you have to see the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. I loved the Temple of Heaven at night, and the Summer Palace is beautiful; it is also worth walking around the hutongs, exploring some of the grand museums, and seeing the grandeur of Tiananmen Square. You get a sense of the message that the Party wants to send to people through the design, layout, and architecture of the city.
4. Hangzhou: I spent only four hours here but will never forget it. Biking around the West Lake is a blissful experience, and some of the canal areas are lovely. I would have also checked out some of the tech areas if I had time.
5. Zhangjiajie: Interesting not because of the nature per se, which is stunning, but because of the way in which the Chinese construct their nature destinations. In some ways, the escalators carved through the mountainside and giant cable cars whisking you across the landscape are more impressive. Combine with Chongqing for a long trip of being smacked on the head with the scale of Chinese progress.
6. Datong: A great day trip or overnight trip from Beijing. The Yunggang Grottoes were probably the best tourist “attraction” I have seen in China; unspeakably beautiful. Also worth checking out the old city, which was almost fully reconstructed due to the Herculean efforts of Geng Yenbo (immortalized in the BBC documentary, the “Chinese Mayor”).

I would also recommend going off the beaten path and away from some of the tourist areas, particular because people are often more curious and friendly, and it is easier to have conversations with them. I quite enjoyed eight hours in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia; Yinchuan, in Ningxia Province, and Chengde, in Hebei Province. All three are relatively prosperous areas, but not as thriving as, say, Beijing or Shanghai. I recall the words that same Beijing think tank writer:

> People invited to China often come just to Beijing, or they are only shown the best and brightest of China, so go to the poor places. China’s GDP per capita is still 13,000, well below the US. There are poor places in Beijing, even close to Beijing in Hebei Province. The southwestern areas and northeastern areas are also of particular interest. We talk about 800 million people lifted out of poverty, but the IPL (international poverty line) is still very low.
> 

I think you do learn a lot from visiting these places that see very few foreigners. It was simultaneously one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life (especially with the constant stares) and one of the most enriching (chatting with friendly people). I will also say that the north did feel friendlier than the south on average, speaking as someone who doesn’t know Chinese.

**Other advice for those studying abroad:**

- One thing that I did early on in my time in China was write down a list of questions and curiosities I had. I was curious to learn about rural life; to observe how a slowing economy had affected people; to understand the Chinese technology landscape; to learn about what people thought about the US, and politics in China. I would recommend it.
- I would take more advantage of my time at a university by talking to students! I regret that I made friends with very few Renmin students. If you study at a university, go play basketball or soccer and get to know the students, many of whom speak excellent English.
- Email people in fields you are interested in and meet them: a few weeks into the program, I realized that I could just do this. I had some amazing chats with researchers studying Chinese public policy, the AI safety landscape in China, and more. I would have liked to do more.
- Learn Chinese. I underestimated how quickly you can level-up and get good. It really makes a huge difference towards connecting with people; Chinese people love when foreigners speak Chinese.

If you email me (see my contact page), I can give you some more specific advice and even connect you with people that might be interesting to you!

**Concluding thoughts**

I am tremendously grateful for the kindness that I experienced over and over in China. Many Chinese people went out of their way to help me navigate, offer advice, or simply strike up a conversation and make me feel less like an outsider. I also was struck by how incredibly kind and helpful the strangers I reached out to were; how they went out of their way to connect me to others they knew, spoke English even if it wasn’t their most comfortable language, and in general made me feel welcome. I leave China with a vivid impression of their warmth and generosity.

**As promised...my funniest photos**



[^1]: This is arguably one of the best perks of traveling in China, namely that many people exhibit curiosity for who you are and where you are from. Many people have never seen a *wai guo ren* before. This is unlike more cosmopolitan or touristy countries like Japan, which tend to receive a lot of people.

[^2]: For one, their intelligence means that they can hear a fragment of a conversation and understand the full context immediately.
