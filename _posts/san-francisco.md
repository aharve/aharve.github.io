On my first long walk across San Francisco, I experienced awe.

It was a quiet Saturday morning in Ingleside Heights, about a 20-minute walk away from my apartment in Daly City. A thick layer of fog hung over me as I passed by rows of colorful, tightly-packed homes. Every home was an empire, brimming with flowers and funky paraphernalia on the front entrance; the splash of color and design transforming what could have been a neighborhood of dreary, mass-produced homes into one where every home was distinctive, and held a surprise.

I had no path in mind, except to go up. Slowly I traced the outline of the large hill, stopping to catch my breath every so often and turn around behind me as the vastness of San Francisco came further into view. Surely this can’t possibly keep going, I wondered. And yet, at every intersection I was greeted by a steeper road.

I finally reached a park, with road being replaced by crunchy dirt. After the last climb, I reached the top of the hill, and found myself staring at San Francisco in its entirety, at least the low-lying part: the other hills that dotted the city had their peaks engulfed in fog. A vast expanse of tighlty-packed homes, identical in form to the ones I had passed, spanned the valleys, like the rainbow-like skin of some sleeping beast. The wind beat against my back, a light mist touching my skin.

It had been a few days since I had arrived in SF, and I was feeling lost and homesick. Staring out at the gray, fog-drenched landscape, I somehow felt hope; a hope distilled into this intense buzz that reverberated in my head as I marched onwards.

I’ve been fascinated by San Francisco and the Bay Area for a long time. 

Partly this is because I am a nerd. I learned to code relatively early, and I liked the rush that came after an intense session of debugging, or the feeling of building something permanent like a website. In high school, I joined a startup and took my first plunge into the world of startup culture. I was transfixed by the Silicon Valley aphorisms, like “you can just do things.”[^1] For aspiring startup founders, SF and the Bay is to them what Hollywood was for wannabe actors; a hub of innovation, with the highest density of motivated, ambitious people who wanted to change the world. I wanted to be one of them. While I eventually drifted away from startups, my interest in them—and the place that many of them called home—never died down.

I also found something inspiring about the nature in the Bay Area. Another defining feature of my time in middle and high school was as a runner. I loved the nature in the Bay (Massachusetts Bay, mind you!) but always wondered what it would be like to run in San Francisco across the Twin Peaks, or the San Bruno Mountains ridge. I was eager to figure out exactly what being surrounded by perfect weather and resplendent natural beauty did to the minds of people here.

These two prevaling interests were brewing in my mind as I touched down in SFO about a month ago. I had arrived in a city with no real connections to speak of (besides some family), armed with a strong motivation for attempting to better understand this hugely consequential slice of the American experiment.

---

I think of my time partially as escape. Much like a retreat in the countryside, my stay in the Bay Area afforded ample time for uninterrputed leisure and rumination. The vieux riche had their chateau by the sea; I had my 10-person group house next to the Daly City BART. They sipped some refined tea while watching their horses prance around the estate; I made QwikTea in 5 minutes and stood outside in the mist watching snails. Where I had them beat was in nature, which I took advantage of in my long walks across the coast, through neighborhoods and mountains.

The moody fog lends itself well to reflection, and a kind of taming of the mind.[^2] My brain is often crowded with thoughts and aspirations; I maintain a running list of the random ideas that float into my brain, desperate to not lose them in the cyclical periods of destruction and creation that befalls my memory. At the same time, in this sea of ideas, I find myself paralyzed—there’s too much I want to do. I want to learn about so many things: the political history of modern India and the indpendence movement; the era of from the Gilded Age to the late 1930s, a period of immense optimism and excitement for technology, for American industrial might, and for building the grandest cities in human history. I want to build a transformer from scratch and learn everything about artificial intelligence. I want to read classical literature. I want to learn Hindi and Mandarin, and help preserve the dialect spoken by family for generations. I want to create software again. 

The combination of being mostly alone in an environment like this means that I can figure out my priorities. I thought of Beauvoir’s existential projects: how, in the face of the overwhelming meaninglessness of the world, we had to create our own meaning; how, by embarking on meaning-making projects, defined by ourselves rather than by external pressures, we could become agents of our own destiny. The Silicon Valley ethos again of just doing things permeated my brain. 

Again, this is idealistic, but few places embody this extraordinary ambition to leave one’s mark on the world that the Bay Area does. Paul Graham has a piece, in his typical grandiose style, about the messages that cities send to their inhabitants: for New York, money drives everything; the intense hustle and ambition that defines it is all about gaining wealth. In Washington, D.C., exclusivity and pedigree matter; Graham writes that, “in DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who you know. You want to be an insider.” But SF and the Bay Area is about power and impact—as Ruxandra Teslo notes, it is astounding to have a place with such a high concentration of wannabe Napoleons (again, how we get from B2B SaaS to that is questionable, but the aspiration is still there). A portion of the people building superintelligence are certainly in it for the extraordinary wealth, but many also seem to view it in civilizational terms, seeing it as the final stage in the grand arc of progress that has defined the world (except for Zuck, who still can’t seem to think outside of algorithms).

I don’t know where I’m going with this. I wanted to stop thinking so much and start doing things. I wanted to stop doing things so much and start thinking. I decided to think first. I wanted to become an expert in something. The surface-level wish was always to have something that I could talk endlessly about, or more cynically something where I could show off my knowledge to others. But the deeper wish was to truly have something I knew about, a thing that I understood in a nuanced way. The world is so complicated, but I wanted to point to one big thing, and say oh…I think I’m actually getting this.

As an example, war was one of those topics that I couldn’t grasp. It didn’t seem to make sense how such horrific violence could emerge—what was the logic behind acts that would lead to greater losses on both sides than if the conflict hadn’t occurred? I resolved to understand international relations, and to apply it to the most important foreign policy issue: US-China relations. The effects of AI on the world was the other big issue that dominated my mind. I discarded everything else during that summer and focused on just trying to deeply understand these two (admittedly large) topics. These were my projects.

Without further ado, my observations:

1. Daly City, Millbrae, and to a large extent, the western left half of SF, absolutely brim with (East) Asian culture and influence (Chinese in particular). Apart from perhaps Queens in NYC, some parts of California (LA), and Hawaii, there’s basically nothing like this anywhere else.

    a. This is not just a Chinatown. This is China embedded into the very fabric of the metro area. There are Chinese grocery stores, Chinese people everywhere taking the bus or walking around, old and young Chinese people, old Chinese buildings. And then add the influence of Korea, the Phillippines, and Japan. This feels like the Asian center of the country (again, rivaled by NYC).

    b. This is also basically the case in South Bay for Indian Americans and affluent East Asians, although I have less experience personally with it. But from my experience in Sunnyvale, Saratoga, and Palo Alto, I think this is true. Unreal. Reminds me of Dallas, a bit.

2. Today, when I left Palo Alto, it was 86 degrees. When I got to Daly City, about ~1.5 hours later, it was 62 degrees. Whoa.

3. Public transit in the Bay Area is underrated. BART is pretty good, but it takes a while to cross the Bay. MUNI is very solid, and the trams are cool. SamTrans has extensive reach and is extremely reliable. CalTrain is off-the-charts good—fast, electric, frequent. Most transit in the Bay, relative to other metro areas, is very expensive—BART is the worst of these offenders. It adds up fast.

4. SF is extraordinarily beautiful. There is nothing like feeling the wind around you as you stand on the Twin Peaks, above the fog, almost in your own world. Or walking along the Embarcadero and seeing the Bay Bridge. Or meandering across the steep, hilly neighborhoods, catching glimpses of the skyline between houses. Sure, it can often be dirty and chaotic. Having been downtown a bunch, I conclude that I don’t really like it. But the rest of the city is so full of beauty and surprises that it makes up for it.

5. Urban life in SF looked pretty vibrant to me—perhaps not as lively as Chicago in the summer, but there were lots of kids, parents with strollers, people enjoying the sun. Year-round good weather would make a difference, I think.

6. On the first week, I biked from downtown SF, through Yerba Buena and the Mission District, to Daly City. On that initial stretch, I saw more homeless people than I had ever seen in my life. They seemed to have their own internal community and network of trust, though, but it was remarkable to see, coming from the East Coast + Midwest.

7. The fog is most beautiful in the evening, and especially when it hangs above the background and is thick, making the world around you feel ethereal and ephemeral.

8. SF’s architecture is seriously underrated. The built environment looks nothing like the East Coast and the Midwest (barring some parts of Pilsen and Little Village). The best comparison is Honolulu—both cities had a very similar feel (and high levels of homelessness, incidentally).

    a. A big portion of the housing stock are small, tightly packed homes with adobe and stucco facades, reminiscent of the Mission style. My street in Daly City is like this. Unlike Chicago or Boston, though, these homes are colorful and often richly decorated. It reminds me of how people decorate and color cheap, mass-produced housing in Mexico.

9. I think my favorite part of the Bay Area so far is Berkeley. The campus itself is so scenic (the Campanile!), and the views of the Marin Headlands are unreal. The area also seems brimming with culture and life in a way that Stanford doesn’t (Palo Alto is hardly a college town, and Stanford is so isolated from everything).

10. Yes, it’s true that AI is everywhere. SF is plastered with ads about vibe-coding, agents, and automating everything. You also see anti-AI ads in various places. My god if I see another promptql.io ad (”You just raised your series B. Vibes won’t cut it”), I will lose it.

    a. Actually, the promptql.io ads pale in comparison to how many Mullvad VPN ads there are everywhere. But VPNs are respectable, so I’ll take it.

11. Everyone on the morning CalTrain Express train is on their computers, most reviewing PRs on Github, checking emails, or coding on VSCode or Cursor.

12. It’s hard to get a good pulse on Bay Area culture because I just know and have interacted with very few people here. Culture is also this strange and ambiguous thing, especially in a place as transient as SF. It also certainly is not as monolithic, so take this with a grain of salt.

    a. One, it seems much more laid back. People don’t dress formally, and tend to come in and leave work whenever at my office. I think this is different in Bay Area startup culture though.

    b. Two, there is an incredibly high incidence of tech and that obviously influences the people we interact with. I’ve gone to a few meetups, and there are lots of people in tech. Generally they seem a bit more anxious these days. Job security has largely disappeared in the wake of layoffs and comforts have rolled back a lot.

    c. Three, the kids are really freakin’ smart (at least the ones doing internships at Hoover). Most are sophomores in high school coding. They seem adult-ish, but I also get the sense that they aren’t that friendly/affable. This could be COVID at play, though.

    d. In general, this place doesn’t seem that friendly. But I feel like people say this about every place. I’m honestly not sure Chicago is that much friendlier (actually, hmm that’s not true, I think strangers are more willing to chat or initiate conversation).

13. In-N-Out today was packed to the brim. Their menu was also tiny. I have to try their fries. And get a burrito at the Green Burrito locations at Carl’s Jr.

14. Crowds of homeless people in the Mission District next to ads advertising for the automation of human tasks is peak SF.

    a. The Mission District is a fascinating place. On the main commercial corridors, it resembles your typical Hispanic neighborhood, but with its own chaotic flair—colorful graffiti and murals across the walls, plastered with posters, tons of homeless people walking around, open markets with people selling all kinds of things on the road, throngs of people moving about. It reminded me of a seedier Little Village—I loved it.

    b. Hispanic neighborhoods in general abound in the southeastern parts of SF, and they always feel like a slice of chaotic, crowded Mexico in the US. Excelsior (which maybe used to be Chinese?, now everything Hispanic) is another favorite. On a Thursday evening, the streets were brimming with shops, and a group of energetic people were singing the Lord’s praises at one of those churches that could be a shop.

15. Maybe I went at the wrong time, but for all the hype, Mission Bay and Dogpatch felt dead to me. I meandered along 3rd Street, spotting the OpenAI headquarters (no signage at all!) and the YC headquarters (again, no signage!). The remaking of the formerly industrial environment is cool—you see big warehouses and union halls alongside fancy eateries and tech spots.

16. I didn’t quite get to see Bayview, but from the tram windows it seemed like a fairly normal low-income neighborhood: discount stores, pawn shops, and the occasional funky establishment.

17. Oakland, like the rest of the Bay Area, is full of contrasts. Look out the window of BART and you’ll see some of the largest complexes of homeless people imaginable—whole tent communities with vigorous life atop abandoned buildings and below highways.

    a. In the lifecycle of neighborhoods, Fruitvale is officially in Chaotic Hispanic-Transition Mode (!). Chill during the day, and the food scene seems good.

    b. I think I saw the most beautiful view of the Bay from the hills behind Oakland, after seeing the redwoods. After being shrouded in fog for a while, the clouds finally cleared, revealing the hazy skyline and surrounding mountains, drenched in light. Nearly brought a tear to my eye.

    c. It is difficult to reckon with the suffering and deprivation baked into some of the most beautiful surroundings in the world. One might say it lends a kind of pathos, a tragedy to this place—where the strivers of the world and the downtrodden congregate together.

18. The Tenderloin is the only place in Daniel Lurie’s SF where I truly felt unsafe. There are many homeless and mentally ill people. There is trash strewn on the street, people shouting, drugs being done out in the open, disabled people in wheelchairs congregating on crowded sidewalks. It is a sad place and I left unsettled.

19. Pervasive drug use and mental illness are not just bad for the homeless; they erode societal trust. On the BART, a man asked me for $10. It was an emergency: he needed to get on the CalTrain. I was alone with him in the car. I gave him the money. If there were people, I would have said no. Maybe it was an emergency, or maybe he was trying to extort me ten dollars.

    a. An old lady in a wheelchair outside Daly City BART asked me to wheel her to the bus stop. I did so. I kept wondering when she was going to ask me for money, or yell incoherently, or pull out a knife. She did none of those things, but SF erodes trust.

20. I think it’s undeniable that there is at least some link between the incredible innovation here and the climate/geography. My theories:

    a. (1) (natural) beauty inspires ambition. Standing on top of a mountain makes you feel like you can be something great. No ugly place has ever produced great things.

    b. (2) More concretely, the consistency of the climate means that you never have to wonder what the temperature will be. And in cold or hot weather, you stress more; more of your faculties are devoted to combating the weather.

21. I’ve never been in a place with such rich smells. E.g., walking through forests and breathing in the pine tree smell, or experiencing the smell of flowers on hikes or even through SF streets.

I’m not sure there’s a big message at the end of this. It wasn’t a monumentally transformative experience, but I think it changed me in impercetible ways that will become more clear over time.

I liked SF. I miss the colorful houses, the trees with splotches of color, the moody fog hanging perpetually over Daly City. I miss the people I met, and the communities I found there. But I don’t miss the buzz at the top of the Ingleside Heights hill, a buzz that distilled hope and awe and optimism for the future into a potent drug for action. It’s still there.
