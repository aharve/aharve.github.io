### **I.**

*“Are you from India?”* 

Three bespectacled Chinese men, not much older than me, stare with wide smiles on their faces. I give a half nod—my parents are from there, but I go to university in the US. *“What do you study?”* I reply with computer science, even though I’m halfway through the process of ditching the program after a bad rout in Systems Programming. Their eyes light up. *“Oh, many people from India study computer science!”* 

I nod again with a smile. *"Do you have some time? We can show you what we are working on, maybe you can help us with something.”* Half-thinking that they racially profiled me because they thought I would be smart in computer science, I laugh and agree. 

They usher me into the building and up to the third floor, a kind of entrepreneurial maker space, and start chatting eagerly. One of them has perfect English after doing university abroad; the second can get by with some difficulty; and the third can’t speak a word. All three of them sit across me on a table. One of them slides me their laptop, opened to the Claude AI website.

*“So I’ve been having some trouble making the payment to access Claude Pro,”* he begins, *“because for some reason it won’t accept my credit card.”* I take a closer look: does he even have an account? I ask him to make one, and he turns the tab to show me the phone verification page. He scrolls through the list of countries whose phone codes are accepted; one, alas, is conspicuously absent. In a small gesture of conciliation for US-China relations, I let him use my phone number to access Claude. He is ecstatic.

Gradually I learn that they are entrepreneurs, a team of post-grad students building an app for patients to easily access and discover traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). One of them is a *Beida* economics student who handles the business side; another is an ex-Bytedance programmer. Together, they are my first introduction into the Beijing entrepreneurial ecosystem.

There are two countries that are building the future today. One of them is the US. The other is China.

I believe that technological progress has a profound impact on society. Riding on the *Gaotie*, passing by nuclear power plants and sleek highways, automated agriculture and solar panels, one can feel this truth deep in their bones. It is as true in the *Gaotie* as it is in the Beijing Subway, where exhausted commuters stare at their phones, scrolling endlessly through *Douyin* or *Xiaohongsu*. And it is as true in these places as it is in the Taiwan Strait, where the massive marshalling of military might that has American policymakers shaking in their boots is due exclusively to the ferocious technology of war: drones, ships, planes, and the energy and intelligence which powers them.

Two decades ago, the West looked to Japan as the harbinger of the future. Visiting Tokyo in the late-1990s and early 2000s, we found their singular aesthetic vision of the future intoxicating. It was one that encompassed bullet trains and heated toilets, neon-drenched megacities, the latest and greatest in consumer electronics and cars, and quirky cultural exports. Today, while Japan is still a force to be reckoned with, it is not unreasonable to say that this vision never came to be; the pleasures and curiosities of Japan’s high-tech future are more kitsch than reality.

If Japan was the West’s steadfast foil for progress, today that country is China, and in many ways, it will likely prove to be more consequential in human history than Japan ever was. This is because it is the only other country that is building what I view as the most important technology of the 21st century, and perhaps of all time: artificial intelligence.

China’s universities are world-beating in AI, on par or even surpassing their American counterparts: Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang rank among the top ten. It has a group of frontier labs that bear a stark resemblance to our set in the US, from ragtag upstarts like Deepseek and Moonshot AI, to corporate behemoths like Alibaba, Bytedance, and Tencent. These companies are in intense competition, with many pushing ceaselessly towards some version of AGI.

My university is Renmin University, itself a top-tier university for AI. It is in the Haidian District, one of the great epicenters of innovation in the world. Just down the street are two of the world’s best universities (Peking and Tsinghua) and many of China’s biggest tech companies, like Baidu, Didi, Bytedance, and Meituan, are headquartered here. 

In this environment, I was incredibly curious to better understand the Chinese future, particularly as it relates to AI. In particular, I had three central questions:

1. *What is China’s technological ecosystem like, and how is AI reshaping it?*
2. *How does the state perceive technology, and AI in particular?*
3. *What is the aesthetic or philosophical vision for China’s future?*

This is an essay about entrepreneurship, and part one of two (the second essay deals more closely with questions of aesthetics and philosophy with respect to technology).

### **II.**

Andy, the intrepid ex-Bytedance programmer I met last week, invites me to the first meetup of VibeFriends, but he can’t make it. In a bizarre series of messages on WeChat, he tells me about a hackathon coming up soon. His vision is to make an animal translation app: put in words, get out animal speech. In fact, he sends me two websites that purport to do this for dogs: lo and behold, when I type in, “Hello world,” I get out a series of incoherent barks (”bark bark…bark” as a matter of fact). He seems utterly serious. For a moment I begin to wonder if such a software is actually possible myself.

The VibeFriends group, well, is exactly what it sounds like: a meetup of people who “vibe-code”, i.e., use AI tools and agents to code and build products. Their WeChat page is filled with articles about AI developments and entrepreneurship; a ten-minute highlight reel features interviews with entrepreneurs, many of whom have commented on the life-changing aspects of this group. Their flagship event is Crazy Thursday, a six hour marathon meetup where entrepreneurs come to vibe-code and discuss their products.

A few days pass. Then, *finally*, it is Crazy Thursday.

The VibeFriends space is located at the “AI Genesis Community,” a sprawling office park complex in the Zhongguancun district set aside for AI development. Such a space is not initially surprising to me: I’ve seen other examples in Beijing and Shanghai. Here, for example, are pictures from the Shanghai’s Zhangjiang Innovation District, also referred to as “AI Town”:

<div class="gallery-grid">
  <figure class="gallery-item">
    <img src="/images/china_2/image%203.png" alt="Zhangjiang District" />

  <figure class="gallery-item">

  </figure>
  <figure class="gallery-item">
    <img src="/images/china_2/image%206.png" alt="Innovation District" />
  </figure>
</div>

The state (or the provincial government, specifically) increasingly views “AI” as a real-estate opportunity to capitalize on. Provincial leaders think, in a kind of buzzwordy way, that AI will be a big deal, and that significant profits will go to those who effectively capitalize on it. The logic, then, is to attract all of the startups and labs to your cities and away from others, so *you* reap the economic benefits. This kind of intra-provincial competition has resulted in a number of innovation districts established close to universities or in the outer reaches of cities. They can then provide subsidies to attract major companies and then gain the benefits from agglomeration effects and real estate price increases.

It seems like the state has little idea of what this technology actually is. However, since they still want to attract companies, they feel the need to make the space more AI-themed so it resembles a boring office park less. In Zhangjiang, then, you get all sorts of funny “AI” things like this:

<div class="gallery-row">

  </figure>
</div>

Some of these areas are ghost towns, but the “AI Genesis Community” seems thriving. Its proximity to two world-class universities certainly helps, and in fact it is home to Tsinghua’s big AI labs. More delightfully, it includes AI-themed art, exhibitions, and even a mini-museum, which all give some window into how the state and its academic and corporate partners are thinking about the future.

  </figure>
</div>

I am struck by how positive their vision for the future is. One can sense the palpable wonder and enthusiasm held by people for AI. Their vision of AI progress also seems more ambitious than some of us may have initially thought; they view AI progress as leading towards automated innovators and organizations; the latter being the so-called “Level 5 AI systems” that can “perform complex organizational tasks” and drive social progress. 

I finally make it to the VibeFriends office, at the top floor of a high-rise in the complex, where a handful of people are at their computers. The space is beautiful, with a bar and stunning views of the surrounding area. Within the space is a group of builders with big dreams for the future:

I don’t get much time with **the founder** of VibeFriends, unfortunately. He’s an ex-Bytedance PM who wanted to make a space for entrepreneurs to hang out and build together. Every week they get 20-30 people, and almost all of them have users and are earning revenue. “There are two paths,” he tells me, referring to the choice between seeking investment first and expanding first, “and we take the other one.” Most companies, especially in the US, seek investment first, but the culture in China seems much more about proving oneself through genuine revenue gains (perhaps in part because the investment ecosystem is quite weak compared to the US).

Later, I meet **Emily**, another ex-Bytedance employee who left because she wanted “to make [her] own thing, to make something for myself.” She’s building an AI resume and mock interview website, and even mentioned the notorious AI startup Cluely (”good for interviewees, bad for companies”). Another guy, **ABC**, is building an app to help kids with dyslexia read. He’s a true AI nerd: he tells me about all the tools he uses enthusiastically, from Google Antigravity (”go use Gemini 3.3, it’s amazing”) to Bytedance’s TRAE, an AI coding agent which others mentioned as well. He’s also planning to not go to college, telling me that, “you only memorize useless facts.” This is the back of his laptop:

![image.png](/images/china_2/image%2014.png)

By far the most fascinating character is **Peter**, a Canadian-Chinese serial founder (who also happens to be ex-Bytedance). He came to Beijing from Singapore, where he was based, with no return tickets and no plan except to recruit people for his startup. Why Beijing? 

> I had the feeling that China was definitely going to win the AI race, so I wanted to be a first mover and take advantage of it…There’s a great amount of talent here, and the culture is much better than SF. Working in Bytedance, I saw how much more collaborative people are. There’s also not a lot of great startups coming out of SF; it seems like they are trying to revive it but it is not working.
> 

What was so great about Bytedance? Peter tells me:

> I think Bytedance will become the most valuable company in the world. It’s done what Meta hasn’t—innovated and successfully spun out good products. At Meta, they just know how to spend a lot of money, but all of their growth comes from acquiring companies, not scaling their own innovations. When I worked at Bytedance, TikTok was maybe only 1% of their revenue…Bytedance succeeds because it has a playbook for making winning products, and then it has 100 people stick to that playbook so it is a success…They work you hard, of course.
> 

And on differences between Chinese and American VC environments:

> The American VC environment is deeper but more competitive. In China there is less but investors are more willing to throw out money….If I was incorporated in the US, it would be very difficult to get funding from Chinese investors (and vice versa). With Singapore [where the company is based], I can access both markets. [1]

### III.

In the space of technological progress, there exist many actors. First, there are the innovators—the genius scientists or teams that build the ground-breaking technologies of the future. These are the frontier labs, the MITs and the Tsinghuas, the Googles and the Bell Labs. Then, of course, there are the consumers of the products that are created, like my cab driver that finagles with Kimi trying to listen to our conversation, for instance. And then of course, in the between-space, there exist the dreamers and grifters, the penniless and the powerful, all trying to extract as much value as possible from the frictions between the first two actors: the entrepreneurs.

It is safe to say that China has absorbed some of the constructed mythos that defines entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley: how the CEO is elevated from a petty business-person to a visionary, a world-changer, an architect of the future. 90% of startups may fail, but for those who will themselves past this threshold, they are legends. Chinese entrepreneurs read about these entrepreneurs—Walter Isaacson biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are perennial bestsellers—and certainly embody some of their aesthetic and intellectual characteristics.

One of these entrepreneurs is Gao. He is the magnetic personality at the center of *Ming Guang* (Mining Goat), a data science startup based in Beijing that I get the chance to visit along with Ludo as part of his “Organizational Behavior in the Digital Age” class.

Gao is a large man, boisterous and talkative and intellectual. He sits towards the side of the large table and spends the first thirty to forty minutes of our meeting giving a sweeping history of the startup. “Will the American be able to understand?” he asks my friend Ludo. I respond with a grin, holding up my Yuanbao app: “AI 翻译!”

The origin story of the company is funny. Gao tells us:

> When I started this company, I honestly had no idea how to run a business—I only knew how to organize reading groups and hold team meetings. So in the beginning, the company’s early form was essentially me gathering a group of students to read together. For the first six months, there wasn’t much else; we just sat together and went through books one by one. We read about blockchain, then recommendation systems, then AI, followed by deep learning
> 

And then his first idea, was—if you can believe it—an AI-automated organization, inspired by Google’s AI Town. “My ideal vision was to create a company that operates so efficiently—each person would manage 5 billion in value…we began exploring how to make different agents form an organic organization to accomplish specific tasks”

As countless unprofitable vending machines can tell us, AI-operated organizations are still a far off vision with the current tech. No bother. Gao turned his mind to more pragmatic aims:

> We generally choose scenarios that the big players don’t pay much attention to—it’s like a lion trying to squeeze into a rabbit hole; they just can’t get in. Therefore, a key strategy for such companies is to position themselves either upstream or downstream.
> 

For an AI enthusiast, what is upstream? Data, of course. And Gao saw China as possessing an enormous advantage with regard to data, one that other companies, especially in the US, didn’t have.

> When competing with companies like OpenAI or the entire U.S. AI market from a macro perspective, we often refer to three key elements: computing power, data, and talent.

Talent—or what we might call algorithmic expertise—determines the depth of disciplines like deep learning, both in terms of the quantity and quality of professionals. In terms of computing power, the situation is mixed—we have both strengths and weaknesses. Our advantage lies in abundant energy resources and large-scale infrastructure, but we have less time for deliberation compared to the U.S. A key strength lies in our scale – we have a vast number of supercomputing centers. For instance, we have a branch in Wuzhen collaborating with the local "Wuzhen Light" supercomputing center, which is nationally renowned. Our observation is that its computational power is less than 30% utilized, meaning over 70% of its capacity sits idle daily. Regarding the second element, data, we've identified a pattern: from a macro perspective, China's data reserves are enormous, making it the country with the largest data holdings globally. However, even domestic cloud service providers struggle to fully manage and track this volume effectively.
> 

Simply put, there is a lot of data but few ways to feasibly obtain it. Gao noticed this as well when he would do analytical work, like report writing; namely, that it is very difficult to find an effective platform that provides legal, compliant, and high-quality data for SMEs or individual users.

Data volume is massive, but efficiency is low. The market lacks private institutions and is dominated by public institutions, like data exchanges, but they are hardly ideal:

> Let’s imagine other failed markets—what do they look like? Take the era of Prohibition in the U.S., for instance, during the dominance of Puritan values before World War II. Have any of you seen the movie Once Upon a Time in America? Its backdrop is precisely that period of Prohibition. In Chicago, organized crime gangs made a fortune from bootlegging alcohol…

If we were to draw an analogy for the current data market, it's essentially in a state of disarray precisely because there aren't enough legitimate entities engaged in this business. We've noticed that in many data transaction cases, the current state of the data market is widely disliked. For example, personal privacy data is circulating illegally on the market with no oversight, precisely because the methods used are also illegal. This creates a vicious cycle, all due to an underdeveloped and incomplete market.
> 

So Gao wants to solve this market, and finds that he has returned from the pragmatic to the ambitious. “As a startup, this can be described as a bold decision—perhaps even somewhat reckless…startups are generally advised against pursuing overly ambitious, all-encompassing platform-level initiatives.” Some investors even asked him if he was worried about legal or governmental risks.

But Gao noticed something. Professor Zhou Qiren at the National School for Development in Peking (and, I assume, a proponent of private enterprise involvement in data circulation), was cited and referenced in important policy meetings, and was later appointed to Monetary Policy Committee of the People's Bank of China. Along with the inclusion of Ant Group’s chief economist to the MPC, both of these data points signaled a shift towards encouragement in market participation.

He has a long monologue about the economics of data trading, and why treating data like a real world asset (RWA) is a bad idea. Eventually, he tells us about his decision to create a Data as a Service platform: charge small businesses or students 3 RMB per day to access relevant data, which extends to even private data like user profiles, which is okay given that this will be an above-ground, legitimate exchange. Yes, this might be completely illegal now — but he is confident that the government is supportive of the overall goal of legitimizing this enterprise.

While telling us about his organizational strategy, Gao makes some interesting quips. First, on how to improve organizational efficiency, he references a number of historical figures from classical China to support his idea of “maximum combat effectiveness:

> Strategically, the most important point is that everyone believes in the same trend and shares the same goal—all aligning with the company’s mission. You could say we share a common vision. Though it might sound abstract or macro, when everyone is united under one objective, especially in a small team of just four or five people, it can unleash maximum combat effectiveness. History offers many validations—small, cohesive, and united teams, like the legendary Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei, exemplify this.
> 

And another historical analogy, on intentionality in organizational structure:

> As an organization evolves, it naturally develops hierarchies. In its early stages, it operates like a tribal republic, then goes through a period of authoritarianism before maturing into a hierarchical system, eventually functioning like a modern machine. We try to avoid this progression because although the organization evolves in a structural sense, its actual effectiveness often diminishes. This has been validated through many historical cases. For example, Brazil remained a primitive tribal republic, while the Ming Dynasty developed a highly sophisticated cultural system. Therefore, we strive to design our own organizational structure deliberately.
> 

Ludo asks about international funding given the current state of US-China relations. Gao brushes the problem off: as long as the proper FDI regulations are complied with, there is no issue. The current situation doesn’t even prohibit listing one’s company in the US, as long as you register pre-listing with the relevant authorities. When he brings up the “Didi incident”—a notorious case in which Didi’s record-breaking IPO in New York was blocked by Chinese authorities—Gao brushes it off. “It's the same, right? They still went ahead with it, paid the fine, and the matter was settled.”

### IV.

Ultimately, understanding entrepreneurs is exciting because they represent the forefront of technological adoption. The innovators often may not understand the full implications of the technologies they build, but the entrepreneurs who build from their scaffolding do; in some ways they have to, in order to seize the market opportunities that emerging technologies bring. For this reason, peering into the psychology of entrepreneurs is one of the best ways to understand how new technologies are perceived, and how they will be deployed into the real world. 

At the same time, there is a fine line between grift and greatness, some of which I definitely felt in encounters with entrepreneurs I met. One can sense that some amateurism and naivete that accompanies the great roiling enthusiasm for this new technology; such a phenomenon is observable in the US as well, of course.

When I think back to my encounters with entrepreneurs, I am struck by their enthusiasm for the technology, as well as the newfound freedom they feel through vibe-coding. Entrepreneurs are much more concerned with pragmatic visions rather than lofty goals, and generally seek to earn revenue and gain traction before seeking revenue.

Finally, do entrepreneurs think in the terms of binary US-China competition? 

In some ways, I witnessed during my time there the further cleaving of US and Chinese technological ecosystems in the AI era: how the two worlds, severed by the Great Firewall, are operating in increasingly different spheres of economic, social, and technological production. Chinese AI thinkers post on Zhihu and WeChat, while American AI thinkers write on LessWrong and Twitter. Chinese developers use Chinese AI models and Chinese software, given the geopolitical instability; American developers also feel pressured to shift to American models. And the era of free FDI is increasingly fading as capital, both Chinese and American, stays close to allies. Even research collaborations between the US and China are falling under scrutiny in an era of great power competition. It is no understatement to say that we are witnessing a profound separation and isolation between the two great powers, playing out most dramatically in the realm of technology.

On my last night, I finally paid a visit to the iconic AGI Bar in Zhongguancun Innovation Street. For those who don’t know, this is literally what it looks like:

<div class="gallery-row">
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">
    <img src="/images/china_2/image%2015.png" alt="AGI Bar Sign" />
  </figure>
  <figure class="gallery-item col-1-2">
    <img src="/images/china_2/image%2016.png" alt="AGI Bar Interior" />
  </figure>
</div>

15 minutes to 11pm, the bar was nearly deserted, but I was able to chat with the bar keeper Yuan, who was a pretty cool dude. Among others, I asked him how technologists in China thought about the US-China race; he encounters plenty of them in the bar, and is one himself. “It’s certainly a race for the US,” he told me, “the way they are controlling the export of chips. So we are in a race whether we like it or not.”

This is something I increasingly see: the way in which entrepreneurs and technologists increasingly view Americans as an *entity* as competitors. This framing clearly emerges from a market logic—how, in the face of geopolitical constraints, Chinese and American companies alike are forced to think in this dualist frame.

At the same time, though, Chinese technologists are technologists first; and for Yuan, these Chinese developers are simply interested in pushing the frontier, in innovation first.

Standing in the brisk, biting Beijing wind, on my last night in the city, I thought about all those developers, in their Haidian apartments or dorm rooms, pushing and pushing and scaling and scaling further and further. I never got to talk to them, but I knew that, in front of all of the entrepreneurs and amateur users they enabled, these were truly the ones constructing the future, and engendering this vast social transformation. I felt chills.
